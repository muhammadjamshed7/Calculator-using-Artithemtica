## Pull Requests

Conventional Commits use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork rhw repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allow to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
